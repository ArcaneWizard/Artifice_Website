Here's a website I designed for a game called Dusk Knight, which a friend and I spent months coding on the Unity Game Engine (uses C#). This game's website was built with react, has a place where users can wishlist the game, view screenshots/update posts that link to various social media, and fill out surveys so the community gets to influence the development of the game. All the wishlist emails and survey info was stored on mongoDB and this app was built with the MERN stack.
